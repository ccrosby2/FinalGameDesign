#This is a game that play the remake of "Set it Off" by  F. Gary Gray. The film stars Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Kimberly Elise. The developing game has four main characters acheiving a money heist but dramatically getting the reprecussions of their actions. This game only has five chapters that a player will have to distiguish who does what on the final heist to Rob a bank. Most of the chapters in the game involves chronological numbering and random choices for phrases to move to the next chapter. This game is designed to have interpretation on which character seems more appealing to complete the heist. All the chapters in the game do not have as many players in the game as you are playing, which means this is a one player game to be all of the players within the chapter. The object of the game is to play a person in the game and move on to the next chapter as a different person in the game. This program is a adventure game and is a fun opportunity to play one person and see the completion of the heist at the last chapter.
